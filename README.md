# 02_Variable, Object, Type, value

# Assignment spec
Present steps are companion of a more detailed video instructions for this assignment, available in BlackBoard folder for this unit. 

This code is a starter seed of learning management system, think of us starting a new product similar to our university *BlackBoard*. Here we deliver a feature of classroom enrollment management. 



When executed, this program should produce  console interaction as below
> Please enter student data<br />Please enter first name:<br />giorgi<br />Please enter last name:<br />shonia<br />Please enter age:<br />46<br /><br />Student data collected.<br />giorgi shonia of age: 46<br />New class size is 26<br />New class average is 23.4038<br />

Obviously output should depend on input, it should not be "hardcoded".

## Steps

- Please accept `02` assignment from *BlackBoard* link as usual. Visit generated repo `02-object-type-value-variable-yourId` on GitHub. Open Codespace.<br />Please try not to spam Codespaces. If you've created one for this repo before, it's faster and frugal to restart it from [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces). Each repo expects dedicated Codespace, eg Codespace from assignment `01` is not meant to be reused for `02`.
- Please go over included source `class_roster.cpp`. It has suggestions for expected changes and completion. Please make sure program logic and I/O complies with above spec. Three changes are expected, they are highlighted by placeholder comments
>	/*
		<br />(1) pls remove this block comment and enter required  code instead
	<br />*/
- Compile executable. This can be done in number of ways, including running `Build Task` from gui (*Menu > Terminal > RunBuildTask*). Executable will be delivered in `bin` folder as `bin/class_roster`. You can execute this program with
> root@786f2f9df995:/workspaces/02-object-type-value-variable# <span style="color:#0099ff">bin/class_roster</span>
- Once satisfied with correctness of program run `Test` task (*Menu > Terminal > RunTask > TestWithMake*), make sure you pass.
- Stage, commit and push changes. Make sure your code passes in GitHub actions.
- If something goes off, please reach out early on, do NOT struggle. PR associated with this repo is a good place for QA.

# Instructional demo 

We'll go over these notes in unit lecture video, available in BlackBoard folder for this unit. 

## Object, Type, Value and Variable

|  | int (4 bytes)  |  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| age | <span style="color:#0099ff">0x0077FF<br />1010000</span> | `cout << age;`<br />80 |


|  | char  |  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| initial | <span style="color:#0099ff">0x0077FF<br />1010000</span> | `cout << letter;`<br />P |

## Primitive types

`int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`. 
<br />`string` from standard library.

Later we'll see complex, user defined types.

## Variable

- declaration: name and type
- definition: memory allocation
- initiation: assigning initial value

`int age;` // declaration and definition
<br />`age = 12;` // initiation
<br />`int age = 12;` // one-liner, a common all-in-one practice. 

### Naming

Naming rules
- name starts with a letter and contains only letters, digits, and underscores
- C++ is case sensitive
- can't use [keywords](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword)

Naming is important! 

Naming conventions, [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Values

Literals (supplied from source code): 
<br />`"Giorgi"`, 
<br />`12`, 
<br />`3.14`, 
<br />`true`

vs 

supplied at runtime from various sources: user input, calculated from other existing values, web services, external libraries, etc.

## Operations and operators

Unary, binary operators. Take input, modify it and/or produce output. Math ops, logical ops, others.

Operators are type aware. Results are type dependent.

`2 + 3 = 5`

`"2" + "3" = "23"`

`2 + "3"` compiler error. "*Fail fast*".

On the other hand `cout << 2` and `cout << "2"` both work. This is an example of overloading.

### Composite assignments

`n++` incrementing. See research suggestion at *BlackBoard > Discussions*: `n++` vs `++n`.

`n+=2`, read *operators left to right*, that is
- do `+` first, that is, perform `n+2`
- do `=` next, that is take left `n`, take output of previous step `n+2` on the right, ends up `n=n+2`

Example<br/>
`n=1` <br/>
`n+=2` <br/>
`cout << n` will produce `3`

## Conversion, casting

Widening conversion. Implicit.
<br />`char initial = 'a';`
<br />`int age = initial;`

Narrowing conversion, to be avoided.
<br />`int count = 99999999;`
<br />`char initial = age;`

## Consequences of typing
- not all values fit in every object type (including function parameters and returns), must be type compatible;
- the same operation behaves differently with different types, and altogether fails when not applicable

Side discussion: **a challenge of complexity**. 
<br />Best practices: DRY, KISS, SOLID, OOP, design patterns, clean code, unit testing... the list goes on. 
<br />Does strong static typing help?
